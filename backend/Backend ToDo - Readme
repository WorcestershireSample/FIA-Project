         Create connection to database / api and construct const variables to hold their addresses.
         Start on implementing the Spoonacular API as the first tested data processing style < MOST IMPORTANT >
         Begin preprocessing attemtps on image files. Use preexisting prototype code to examine success of preprocessing. Unit Test???
         Establish Server / Client connectivity and begin forking / multi-request handling. < FRONT END SUPPORT REQUIRED >
         Create web scraper API to process ingredients that are odd or require more information as final tested data processing style.
         Begin on Database hosting and creating database of ingredients and tags for second tested data processing style.
