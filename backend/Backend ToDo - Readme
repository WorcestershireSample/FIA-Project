  To Do: Add a constructor for client requests to hold the information of the image, processed data, and anything else we need for communication. 
         Create connection to database / api and construct const variables to hold their addresses.
         Establish Server / Client connectivity and begin forking / multi-request handling. < FRONT END SUPPORT REQUIRED >
         Create web API to process ingredients that are odd or require more information as final tested data processing style.
         Begin on Database hosting and creating database of ingredients and tags for second tested data processing style.
         Create and use Unit Tests. 
         Create final connection that sends data back to client and closes child process / request. < FRONT END SUPPORT REQUIRED >
Done:
         Start on implementing the Spoonacular API as the first tested data processing style
         Begin preprocessing attemtps on image files. Use preexisting prototype code to examine success of preprocessing.
